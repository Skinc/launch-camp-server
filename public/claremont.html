						This year, Launch is partnering with <a href="http://www.afterschoolallstars.org/">After-School All-Stars</a> to bring Launch Camp to Oakland, CA at Claremont Middle School. It is Launch's first offering of an extended course, meeting twice a week after school for ten week sessions throughout the year. Having a more traditional format allows students to schedule large production runs overnight and concentrate their class- time on designing, collaborating, and selling. As always, our goal is to empower students to take action and experience real world results.

											<h3>
												Identifying Resources
											</h3>								
											<h4>
												On the first day of class, students worked together to ideate on products. We wanted them to forget about making the next Facebook, and think about what they could sell this week.
												The first step of the exercise is to exhaust categories of resources: goods, materials, tools, skills, and people. After a few rounds, students circulate and combine their resources into product ideas.

												The first team to finish a product picked a simple one: mason jars filled with colored sugar. It was messy and drew some criticism until recess, when the team sold all five jars immediately. At this point, one skeptical student was in a fit: she couldn't believe something so simple could sell. When she started to come up with competitive ideas, we knew the lesson was sinking in.

												The Power of the Sale
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Not every student creates a compelling product after four classes, but we wanted to get them selling right away. To kickstart their sales, we gave them each some simple wooden postcards sporting the Oakland logo. Then, the students split into teams and searched downtown Rockridge for customers. In 30 minutes, each team made at least $10, and several made over $30. Once every student had money in their hands, they finally believed us: the class was about real-world skills that they can use right away.

												No Prejudice
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Customers with babies or headphones, or who look like they're having a bad day: they can look intimidating - like they'll never buy anything. The students learned that their intuition was often wrong about potential customers. Sometimes a simple 'Hello' changed a frown to an open wallet.

												Traditions
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Each student had their own selling strategies, but one thing was common: we were always running late back from Rockridge! It became a fun tradition to sprint back to school, excited, propelled by pockets full of wadded up cash.
												We also made a strong tradition of daily reflection, making sure students were thoughtful about what worked for their team and what needed to change.

												Expressing Themselves
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Armed with new optimism for their sales skills, students returned to the tools with increased motivation. The teams continued the postcard project with their own illustrations and started on entirely new products. They designed gifts with inspirational quotes, postcards with team logos, shirts with emojis and more. Students loved showing off their ideas and were quick to take them back to the streets of Oakland.

												Gathering Feedback, Seeking Rejection
											</h3>
											<h4>
												If an entrepreneur isn't being rejected, she isn't marketing widely enough. After a few days, each team had experienced some successes and some failures. Each team powered through rejection, updating their pitch, their presentation, or their product until they sold at least three times. By the end of the week one team was selling $100 of postcards in one hour.

											<h3>
												Negotiation
											</h3>
											<h4>
												One thing students love is offering discounts. Customers should never find this out, but if they seem friendly, they can usually name their price. When the kids first approached retail shops, they thought offers of $200 for 200 post cards were great, until they realized the amount of work it would take. Students learned to negotiate carefully when they were investing so much time, and began work on large scale production.

											<h3>
												Efficiency
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Selling one item for $10 was a great feeling, but bulk discounts started eating into students time. One student calculated her hourly rate at $8/hour after she dropped her price to $2 per card. But because their processes were repeatable, they quickly found the value of batching the laser-cutting so they could walk away while machines did the work.

											</h3>
											<h4>
												This batch of products was a bit more ambitious. For example, some students created wooden earrings. The earrings were neat but surprisingly difficult to sell. They decided that, unlike with postcards, they needed cases in order to seem legitimate. Once they spruced up the packaging with nice jewelry boxes, they had great results.
